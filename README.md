# 🧠 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – Deep Learning Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (**DL2.ipynb**) demonstrating the implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification using deep learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model capable of learning image features and making accurate predictions. The notebook includes step-by-step code, explanations, and visualizations to understand how CNNs work internally.

## 🧠 What is a CNN?
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a deep learning model commonly used for:
- Image Classification  
- Object Detection  
- Pattern Recognition  
- Feature Extraction  

CNNs automatically learn spatial features using convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
